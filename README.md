## Introduction
ShareMe - A Secure and Modern Social Media Platform

ShareMe is a full-stack social media application designed for users to share, discover, and engage with images, similar to Pinterest. Built with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity.io, the platform offers a seamless user experience with modern UI components and real-time updates.

In addition to its rich feature set, ShareMe prioritizes user security by implementing robust cybersecurity measures:

Data Encryption: All sensitive user data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
Secure Authentication: Integration with third-party authentication services, such as Google OAuth, provides a secure and convenient login experience.
Input Validation and Sanitization: The application employs strict input validation and sanitization to prevent common vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.
Content Security Policies (CSP): Implementation of CSP helps mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting attacks.
Regular Security Audits: Continuous monitoring and updating of dependencies and codebases to address potential vulnerabilities promptly.
By integrating these security features, ShareMe not only delivers an engaging social media experience but also ensures that user data remains protected against potential threats.
